# Conky
Files for my home conky setup - displays time/date, CPU usage, disk usage, RAM usage and current Plex session playing track.

The Plex session will require python's `plex-api` module to be installed and a token to be provided.

This is designed for a 1080p screen. Space has been left for an audio visualiser at the top and a dock at the bottom, as well as plenty of application space in the middle.
